This README file contains brief data descriptions of all data used in this study. More detailed data descriptions are available within the manuscript in the data descriptions section. 

BRT_files
This folder contains csv files for each of the 4 subregions, each of which include the raw data used in the boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis. This includes pixel coordinates, all BRT variables, and wildfire names. This folder also includes a summary csv table of the BRT results displayed in the bar graphs in Figure 2, including forest type, subregion, number of points, R-squared values, and cross-validated R-squared values. Lastly, this folder includes the code used to generate the regression trees, provided in RStudio format.

Boundaries
This folder includes shapefiles of reference boundaries for States, as well as a Columbia River Basin boundary.

DEM
This folder includes Digital Elevation Model (DEM) raster data used for this study. This includes elevation (“DEM_pnw_clean”) and southness.

LandCover
This folder includes vegetation type and vegetation cover raster data used to determine dominant pre-fire vegetation type (“veg_type01_500m”).

SCF
Snow Cover Frequency (SCF) data is included as individual raster files, from 2001 to 2016. 

Wildfires
This folder includes a shapefile of the locations of wildfires used in this study.

Aspect
This is the aspect data used to derive the southness data.

maxEVI
Maximum EVI raster data is broken up due to data size, and is included in the maxEVI, maxEVIa, maxEVIb, maxEVIc, maxEVId, maxEVIe, and maxEVI_2016rs folders.

Slope
This is the slope data used in the study.

Summer Precipitation
Summer precipitation data is included as individual raster files, from 2001 to 2016.
